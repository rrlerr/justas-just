I want you to generate a complete interactive React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS eCommerce website called **MitsuPrinters** that looks and functions like a modern Shopify-style site.

It should match the design and functionality of this project: a homepage featuring Mimaki printers, with product cards, category sections, modals, sticky navbars, hover animations, AOS scroll effects, and a product showcase carousel.

### Project Requirements:

✅ Tech Stack:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite as bundler
- AOS (Animate On Scroll)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Lucide-react for icons
- State management with `useState` and `react-query` for product fetching (mocked)
- Components should be reusable

✅ Pages:
- `Home.tsx` — main page with hero section, product categories, featured products, product showcase, trust indicators
- Product cards with zoom hover + "View Details" button that opens modal
- Sticky "Add to Cart" button in modal
- Product carousel using `swiper` or `react-slick`
- Product specs like printWidth, speed, and badge (new, eco-friendly, etc.)
- Page layout fully responsive and animated on scroll using AOS

✅ Components:
- `HeroSection.tsx` — banner with heading and CTA
- `ProductCard.tsx` — with hover zoom, price, image, name, description, and modal trigger
- `ProductDetailsModal.tsx` — modal with full product view
- `ProductShowcase.tsx` — large featured product with carousel
- `TrustIndicators.tsx` — icons and text for trust, warranty, support
- `NavBar.tsx` — sticky navbar with logo, links
- `Footer.tsx` — clean footer

✅ Files:
- `src/pages/Home.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/*`
- `src/lib/animations.ts` — fadeInUp and staggerChildren for Framer Motion
- `public/index.html` — includes AOS script/css
- `src/main.tsx` — app root
- `products.json` — sample product data

✅ Bonus:
- Add `_redirects` file in `public/` for Netlify to avoid 404s
- Include `README.md` for setup instructions
- Use mock product API (`/api/products/featured`, `/api/products/category/ink`) — or use static JSON

### The site must look clean, animated, and modern — similar to a Shopify or Webflow eCommerce template.

Now generate the **entire file structure and code**, organized and production-ready.
⚡️ How to Use This Prompt
Paste into ChatGPT with GPT-4 or Pro (like you are using)

Or use it on Gemini, Copilot, or Codeium

Ask it to generate files one by one (start with Home.tsx, then App.tsx, etc.)

Would you like me to generate each of these files for you one by one right now and help you set them up on Replit or Netlify?
